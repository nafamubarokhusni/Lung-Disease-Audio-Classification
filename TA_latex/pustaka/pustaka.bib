ABSTRACT = {This review explores the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for the identification and classification of lung sounds. The article provides a historical overview from the invention of the electronic stethoscope to the auscultation of lung sounds, emphasizing the importance of the rapid diagnosis of lung diseases in the post-COVID-19 era. The review classifies lung sounds, including wheezes and stridors, and explores their pathological relevance. In addition, the article deeply explores feature extraction strategies, measurement methods, and multiple advanced machine learning models for classification, such as deep residual networks (ResNets), convolutional neural networks combined with long short-term memory networks (CNN–LSTM), and transformer models (transformer). The article discusses the problems of insufficient data and replicating human expert experience and proposes future research directions, including improved data utilization, enhanced feature extraction, and classification using spectrograms. Finally, the article emphasizes the expanding role of AI and ML in lung sound diagnosis and their potential for further development in this field.},

    abstract = {Most of the features used by modern automatic speech recognition systems, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and perceptual linear predictive (PLP) coefficients, represent spectral envelope of the speech signal only. Nevertheless, phase or frequency modulation as represented in recent perceptual models of the peripheral auditory system might also contribute to speech decoding. Furthermore, such features can be complementary to the envelope features. This paper proposes a variety of features based on a linear auditory filterbank, the Gammatone filterbank. Envelope features are derived from the envelope of the subband filter outputs. Phase/frequency modulation is represented by the subband instantaneous frequency (IF) and is used explicitly by concatenating envelope-based and IF-based features or is used implicitly by IF-based frequency reassignment. Speech recognition experiments using a standard HMM-based recognizer under both clean training and multi-condition training are conducted on a Chinese mandarin digits corpus. The experimental results show that the proposed envelope and phase based features can improve recognition rates in clean and noisy conditions compared to the reference MFCC-based recognizer.}

This disease has a high mortality and morbidity rate and brings significant social and economic burdens. The prevalence of COPD varies across countries, with the highest rate reported in the United States at 37% and in Indonesia at 3.7%, with the highest prevalence in East Nusa Tenggara (10%). According to WHO, in 2020, COPD became the third leading cause of death globally. The methods used include a systematic summary of 14 data sources to compile information on COPD. The results included definitions, Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Clinical Manifestations, Diaognostic, Assesment, &amp;amp;nbsp;and management of COPD.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
